  Program Operation - The program listens for incoming packets using the LoRa settings in the 'Settings.h'
  file. The pins to access the lora device need to be defined in the 'Settings.h' file also.

  There is a printout of the valid packets received, the packet is assumed to be in ASCII printable text,
  if its not ASCII text characters from 0x20 to 0x7F, expect weird things to happen on the Serial Monitor.
  The LED will flash for each packet received and the buzzer will sound, if fitted.

  Sample serial monitor output;

  1109s  Hello World 1234567890*,CRC,DAAB,RSSI,-61dBm,SNR,9dB,Length,23,Packets,1026,Errors,0,IRQreg,50

  If there is a packet error it might look like this, which is showing a CRC error,

  1189s PacketError,RSSI,-111dBm,SNR,-12dB,Length,0,Packets,1126,Errors,1,IRQreg,70,IRQ_HEADER_VALID,IRQ_CRC_ERROR,IRQ_RX_DONE

  Serial monitor baud rate is set at 9600.
